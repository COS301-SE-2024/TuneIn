### 6.1 Architectural Requirements
1. **Domain-Driven Architecture (DDA)**:
   - DDA emphasizes aligning the software design with the problem domain, focusing on understanding the domain's complexities and modeling them effectively within the system.
   - In TuneIn, DDA would involve identifying key domain entities such as users, rooms, music tracks, and interactions between them. These entities should be accurately represented in the software architecture.
   - Domain experts collaborate closely with software developers to ensure that the architectural decisions reflect the nuances of the music streaming domain.
   - The use of bounded contexts, aggregates, and ubiquitous language, as defined in Domain-Driven Design (DDD), helps maintain a clear and consistent understanding of the domain across the development team.

2. **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**:
   - EDA facilitates loosely coupled, asynchronous communication between system components through the exchange of events.
   - In TuneIn, events could include actions such as user joining a room, queueing a song, or sending a message in a chat room.
   - By decoupling components and enabling them to react to events independently, EDA enhances scalability, fault tolerance, and responsiveness in the system.
   - Event-driven workflows enable real-time updates, notifications, and collaborative features in TuneIn, enhancing the overall user experience.

3. **Component-Based Architecture**:
   - Component-based architecture breaks down the system into reusable, modular components that encapsulate specific functionality and can be assembled to build larger systems.
   - In TuneIn, components could include modules for user authentication, room management, music playback, recommendation engine, and social networking features.
   - Each component has well-defined interfaces that facilitate communication with other components, promoting modularity, maintainability, and code reuse.
   - Component-based architecture supports scalability by allowing teams to independently develop, test, and deploy components, fostering agility and collaboration.

4. **Scalability**:
   - In TuneIn, scalability is essential to accommodate growing user bases, concurrent room sessions, and streaming traffic.
   - Horizontal scalability involves adding more instances of components to distribute the workload across multiple servers or nodes, while vertical scalability involves upgrading hardware resources to handle increased load.
   - Techniques such as load balancing, caching, and sharding can be employed to scale different parts of the system effectively.

5. **Maintainability**:
   - Maintainability encompasses the ease with which a system can be modified, updated, debugged, and extended over its lifecycle.
   - In TuneIn, maintainability ensures that developers can efficiently address bugs, implement new features, and adapt to changing requirements without introducing regressions or compromising system integrity.
   - Practices such as modular design, code refactoring, version control, automated testing, and documentation contribute to maintainability by promoting clean, organized, and understandable codebases.
   - Architectural patterns like MVC (Model-View-Controller) and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) can help enforce separation of concerns and facilitate maintainable code architecture.

### 6.3 Architectural Patterns
#### What we use in our Architecture

1. **Domain-Driven Architecture (DDA)**:
   - **Core Concepts**: DDA emphasizes understanding and modeling the problem domain within the software design. It involves identifying core domain entities, defining their relationships, and encapsulating domain logic within these entities.
   - **Application in TuneIn**: In TuneIn, domain-driven design involves identifying key domain entities like users, rooms, playlists, and interactions. These entities would have associated behaviors and relationships. For example, a "Room" entity might have methods for adding songs, and managing participants. DDA ensures that the software model closely mirrors the real-world domain, leading to a more intuitive and maintainable system.
2. **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**:
   - **Core Concepts**: EDA revolves around the concept of events, which represent significant occurrences or state changes within the system. Events are produced, detected, consumed, and reacted to asynchronously.
   - **Application in TuneIn**: In TuneIn, events could represent various user actions (joining a room, liking a song), system events (room created, playlist updated), or external integrations (new music added from Spotify). EDA facilitates real-time communication and responsiveness by enabling components to react to events asynchronously. For example, when a user joins a room, an event triggers the playback of the current song for that user and notifies other participants.
3. **Component-Based Architecture**:
   - **Core Concepts**: Component-Based Architecture involves breaking down the system into reusable, modular components, each responsible for specific functionalities. Components encapsulate related behavior and data, promoting reusability and maintainability.
   - **Application in TuneIn**: TuneIn can implement components for user authentication, room management, music playback, chat functionality, recommendation engines, and social interactions. Each component provides well-defined interfaces for interaction with other components, allowing developers to update or replace individual components without affecting the entire system. For example, the user authentication component handles user login, registration, and session management independently of other components.

4. **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture**:
   - **Core Concepts**: MVC architecture separates an application into three interconnected components: the Model, View, and Controller. The Model represents the data and business logic, the View displays the data, and the Controller handles user input and interacts with the Model.
   - **Application in TuneIn**: In TuneIn, MVC can be used to structure the application such that user interactions are handled efficiently and logically. The Model could manage data related to users, rooms, and playlists. The View would be responsible for displaying the user interface, showing rooms, playlists, and current songs. The Controller would manage input from users, such as joining a room and updating playlists. This separation ensures a clean codebase, where the business logic, UI, and input handling are distinctly managed, promoting maintainability and scalability. For example, when a user likes a song, the Controller updates the Model, and the View reflects this change, ensuring a responsive and consistent user experience.



#### What we didn't use & why

##### 1. Layered (N-Tier) Architecture

**Description:**
- A traditional architectural pattern that organizes the system into layers, typically including presentation, business logic, and data access layers.

**Reason for Exclusion:**
- **Scalability Limitations**: Layered architecture can become monolithic and difficult to scale horizontally. Each layer often depends on the layers below it, creating tight coupling and potential bottlenecks.
- **Flexibility**: As TuneIn requires real-time updates and high scalability, the tightly coupled nature of layered architecture could hinder the agility needed for rapid feature development and deployment.

##### 2. Client-Server Architecture

**Description:**
- A distributed architecture model where client devices interact with a centralized server for data and processing.

**Reason for Exclusion:**
- **Scalability and Real-Time Updates**: While this model is simple and straightforward, it does not inherently support real-time updates or event-driven interactions as efficiently as EDA. TuneInâ€™s need for real-time notifications and updates is better supported by event-driven and component-based architectures.
- **Single Point of Failure**: A centralized server can become a single point of failure, affecting the overall systemâ€™s reliability and fault tolerance.

##### 3. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

**Description:**
- An architectural pattern where services communicate over a network to provide functionality. SOA typically uses SOAP or REST for service interactions.

**Reason for Exclusion:**
- **Granularity and Independence**: Microservices architecture, an evolution of SOA, offers finer granularity and greater independence of services. This fits TuneInâ€™s needs better by allowing more flexible and independent deployment and scaling of services.
- **Complexity and Overhead**: SOA often involves significant overhead in terms of governance, standards, and tooling, which can be more complex to manage than a component-based approach.

##### 4. Monolithic Architecture

**Description:**
- An architecture where all components and services are packaged together in a single unit.

**Reason for Exclusion:**
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Monolithic architecture is not well-suited for the scalability and agility required by TuneIn. As the user base grows and new features are added, the monolithic structure can become a bottleneck, making it difficult to scale and deploy changes independently.
- **Maintenance**: Updating a monolithic application can be cumbersome and risky, as a single change can impact the entire system.

##### 5. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture

**Description:**
- A decentralized network architecture where each node (peer) can act as both a client and a server.

**Reason for Exclusion:**
- **Consistency and Control**: P2P architecture is less suitable for applications requiring consistent data states and central control over interactions and data management. TuneInâ€™s need for centralized control over user data, rooms, and playlists does not align well with the decentralized nature of P2P.
- **Complexity in Implementation**: Managing consistency, security, and performance in a P2P network can be complex and is often overkill for the requirements of a music streaming and social interaction platform.

##### 6. Event-Sourcing and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

**Description:**
- Event-Sourcing involves storing state changes as a sequence of events. CQRS separates read and write operations to optimize performance and scalability.

**Reason for Exclusion:**
- **Complexity and Overhead**: Event-Sourcing and CQRS introduce significant complexity in terms of maintaining and replaying event logs and managing eventual consistency. While beneficial in some contexts, the overhead might not justify the benefits for TuneIn, especially when simpler and well-supported patterns like EDA and MVC suffice.
- **Specific Use Cases**: These patterns are particularly useful for complex domains with high concurrency and need for audit trails, which may be beyond the current scope of TuneIn.

##### 7. Microservices Architecture

**Description:**
- Microservices Architecture decomposes the application into smaller, independently deployable services, each responsible for a specific business capability. Microservices communicate via lightweight protocols like HTTP or messaging queues.

**Reason for Exclusion:**
- **Experience and Complexity**: The team lacks experience with microservices, and implementing this pattern would add extra difficulty. Given that we are already managing the challenges of Flutter and AWS infrastructure, the additional complexity and learning curve of microservices are not justifiable for this project.
- **Overhead and Maintenance**: Managing microservices involves significant overhead in terms of deployment, monitoring, and inter-service communication, which can complicate development and maintenance.

#### Prioritized Patterns and Their Justification

##### Domain-Driven Architecture (DDA)
- **Alignment with Business Logic**: DDA ensures that the systemâ€™s design closely mirrors the business domain, which is essential for complex domains like music streaming and social interactions.
- **Collaboration with Domain Experts**: Encourages ongoing collaboration between developers and domain experts, leading to a more accurate and adaptable system.

##### Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
- **Real-Time Updates**: Supports real-time notifications and asynchronous processing, enhancing user experience with instant updates and interactions.
- **Decoupling Components**: Facilitates loose coupling between components, improving scalability and fault tolerance.

##### Component-Based Architecture
- **Modularity and Reusability**: Breaks the system into reusable, independent components, promoting maintainability and easier testing and deployment.
- **Scalability**: Each component can be scaled independently, allowing for more efficient resource utilization.

##### Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns**: Separates the application into Model, View, and Controller components, making it easier to manage and scale the codebase.
- **Efficient User Interaction**: MVC allows for efficient handling of user input and dynamic updates to the user interface, which is crucial for an interactive application like TuneIn.
- **Maintainability**: By isolating the business logic, user interface, and input control, MVC promotes maintainability and easier debugging.

#### Conclusion

While other architectural patterns could potentially work for TuneIn, the chosen patternsâ€”Domain-Driven Architecture, Event-Driven Architecture, Component-Based Architecture, and Model-View-Controller Architectureâ€”provide the best fit for the projectâ€™s specific requirements. These patterns offer the necessary scalability, flexibility, and maintainability, ensuring that TuneIn can efficiently handle real-time interactions, growing user bases, and continuous feature enhancements.

### 6.4 Design Patterns
#### **1. Command Pattern**

**Classes Involved**: Message, PrivateMessage, RoomMessage, User

**Justification**: The Command Pattern is used to encapsulate all the information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time. In this application, the pattern is particularly useful for sending messages (both private and room messages). It allows encapsulating the sender, receiver, and the content of the message in a command object.

- **Message Interface**: This defines the sendMessage() method that all concrete message types must implement.
- **PrivateMessage and RoomMessage Classes**: These concrete classes implement the Message interface, providing specific implementations for sending private messages and broadcasting messages in a room, respectively.
- **User Class**: The User class can execute different commands (sendRoomMessage() and sendPrivateMessage()) which utilize the Command Pattern to perform the respective actions.

**Benefits**:

- **Decoupling**: The sender and receiver are decoupled, allowing for more flexible and reusable code.
- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Commands can be stored and thus can provide undo and redo functionality.
- **Logging**: Commands can be logged for auditing purposes.

#### **2. Observer Pattern**

**Classes Involved**: AbstractRoom, Room, User

**Justification**: The Observer Pattern is used to create a subscription mechanism to allow multiple objects (users) to listen to events (messages) and be notified when those events occur. This pattern is ideal for broadcasting messages in a chat room where all users need to receive the messages sent to the room.

- **AbstractRoom Interface**: This interface defines the methods addParticipant(), removeParticipant(), and broadcastMessage().
- **Room Class**: Implements the AbstractRoom interface and maintains a list of users. When a message is broadcasted, all users in the room are notified.
- **User Class**: Users register themselves with rooms to receive messages and can also remove themselves when they no longer wish to receive updates.

**Benefits**:

- **Loose Coupling**: The subject (room) and observers (users) are loosely coupled, allowing for changes without affecting each other.
- **Dynamic Subscription**: Users can dynamically subscribe or unsubscribe to rooms.

#### **3. Decorator Pattern**

**Classes Involved**: AbstractRoom, RoomType, PrivateRoom, PublicRoom, TemporaryRoom, PermanentRoom, ScheduledRoom, UnscheduledRoom

**Justification**: The Decorator Pattern is used to add behavior or responsibilities to objects at runtime. This pattern fits well with the room types which can have various additional features or states (e.g., private, public, temporary, permanent, scheduled, unscheduled).

- **AbstractRoom Interface**: Defines the basic operations of a room.
- **RoomType Class**: Acts as the base decorator, holding a reference to an AbstractRoom object.
- **Concrete Decorators (PrivateRoom, PublicRoom, etc.)**: Each concrete decorator extends the RoomType class and adds specific behavior or state to the room.

**Benefits**:

- **Flexibility**: Behaviors can be added or removed dynamically.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each decorator class handles a specific aspect of the room's behavior.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: New decorators can be added without changing the existing code.

#### **In Summary**

1. **Message Interface and Its Implementations**:
   - The Message interface and its concrete implementations (PrivateMessage, RoomMessage) represent commands that encapsulate the information needed to perform messaging actions.
2. **User Class**:
   - The User class acts as the invoker of commands, allowing users to send both room messages and private messages.
3. **AbstractRoom Interface and Room Class**:
   - The AbstractRoom interface and its implementation in the Room class handle the observer pattern, managing user subscriptions and broadcasting messages to all participants.
4. **RoomType and Concrete Decorators**:

The RoomType class and its concrete decorators (PrivateRoom, PublicRoom, TemporaryRoom, PermanentRoom, ScheduledRoom, UnscheduledRoom) implement the Decorator Pattern to dynamically add responsibilities and features to room objects.
